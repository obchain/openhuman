/**
 * Modal keyboard and focus behaviour, driven in a real browser.
 *
 * Every connector setup flow on `/connections` renders through `ModalShell`
 * (`components/ui/ModalShell.tsx`), which wraps Radix for the focus trap and
 * adds its own focus restore. Its module doc names the bug it was written for:
 * "there was none — Tab escaped the dialog into the page behind it" (:48).
 *
 * **None of that is testable in jsdom.** jsdom has no layout, no real focus
 * ring, and does not implement sequential focus navigation, so `Tab` moves
 * nothing — a jsdom test asserting a focus trap passes whether or not the trap
 * exists. This spec is the only place that behaviour is actually exercised.
 *
 * The vehicle is the MCP `ConnectAuthModal`
 * (`components/channels/mcp/ConnectAuthModal.tsx`): the credential form a
 * declared server's **Connect** button opens. It is the one connector dialog
 * that opens deterministically with no live credentials — the server is
 * declared in `mcp.json` through the core's own RPC with a launcher that never
 * runs — and it is a plain `ModalShell` consumer, so what holds here holds for
 * the others. `mcp-tab-flow.spec.ts` covers what the modal does; this covers
 * only the keyboard and focus surface it does not touch.

/**
 * Declare the vehicle server through the real core. `enabled` is what makes
 * the detail offer a Connect button; the launcher is a command that exits at
 * once, so the background connect the declaration starts fails harmlessly
 * instead of leaving a subprocess behind.
 *
 * The launcher is the bare name `false`, NOT `/bin/false`. `locate_command`
 * (`tinymcp/.../transport/stdio/spawn_env/mod.rs:296-318`) branches on
 * `has_path_separator`: anything containing `/` is taken as a literal path with
 * no PATH lookup, while a bare name is resolved across PATH. `/bin/false` is a
 * Linux-ism — on macOS `false` lives at `/usr/bin/false` — so the absolute form
 * made the launcher unfindable there, the connect failed with `MissingRuntime`,
 * the server never reached a connected state and the vehicle's row never
 * rendered. Every case in this file then timed out on that row, for a reason CI
 * (Linux, where `/bin/false` exists) never sees. The bare name is correct on
 * both platforms.

// TODO(#6398): restore isolated core lifecycle coverage for this browser suite.
//
// STILL QUARANTINED, deliberately. The portability defect above is fixed, which
// unblocks reproducing this locally on macOS, but it is NOT the reported
// failure: the issue describes repeated ECONNREFUSED in CI when the core at
// 127.0.0.1:17788 disappears mid-suite, and that has not been reproduced or
// explained. A run on macOS at `0f1ecc9d2` found the core healthy throughout —
// 414 log lines, no panic or abort, every `mcp_clients_config_set` returning
// ok, and the log ending in the session's own SIGTERM teardown — so the
// premise in the title ("its test core exits") is not established.
//
// Un-skipping now would remove the marker without fixing the behaviour it was
// raised for, which is worse than leaving it: the suite would be restored on a
// guess, and because `.github/workflows/e2e-playwright.yml` is
// `on: workflow_dispatch: {}` with no push or pull_request trigger, nothing
// would contradict the guess automatically.
//
// What restoring this needs, in order: (1) a macOS run, which additionally
// needs #6476 — `e2e-web-session.sh` launches the core through `setsid`, which
// is util-linux and absent on macOS, so the core never starts; (2) a CI run
// that reproduces the ECONNREFUSED with `core.log` and `core-resource.log`
// retained (the workflow uploads both on failure, 7-day retention) to separate
// a runner OOM from an in-process failure.
//
// Worth knowing before deleting instead of restoring: `mcp-tab-flow.spec.ts`
// covers the same route and selector but is entirely mocked — it installs
// `page.route('**/rpc', ...)` and fulfils the RPCs itself, with zero
// `callCoreRpc`. This suite is therefore the only spec exercising this surface
// against a live core.
