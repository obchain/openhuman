/**
 * Managed OpenRouter catalog in the composer's model picker.
 *
 * `#6201` (feat(inference): surface the managed OpenRouter catalog in the model
 * picker) shipped with unit tests only, and those tests mock
 * `listProviderModels` outright — so nothing exercised the chain that actually
 * has to work: browser → core RPC `openhuman.inference_list_models` →
 * `list_configured_models_from_config` resolving the managed backend's URL and
 * session JWT → `GET /openai/v1/models?catalog=openrouter` → back through the
 * picker's render and round-trip helpers.
 *
 * # Why the sibling spec could not cover this
 *
 * `chat-model-override.spec.ts` documents (and deletes) a case that could not
 * be made honest: the only selectable source in this fixture was the managed
 * tier, managed was already the active model, and managed carried no model id —
 * so "select managed" was a legitimate no-op with nothing observable to assert.
 *
 * #6201 is exactly what changes that. Managed now carries a model id, so a
 * selection is observable in the chip label, and the same source can be driven
 * to two distinguishable states. That is what makes these cases possible at all.
 *
 * # What is pinned here, and why each one can regress
 *
 * 1. The managed pane lists catalog models. Before #6201 it showed prose and no
 *    models; a regression in the fetch seam (`fetchSlug`, the managed URL, the
 *    session credential) puts it straight back there.
 * 2. Round-trip. A pinned managed id is encoded BARE, and `selectionFromValue`
 *    used to decode anything without a `:` to null — the selection vanished on
 *    reopen. Only a reopen catches it.
 * 3. A `:free` variant renders its full name. `displayValue` used to split on
 *    `:` as if it were `providerSlug:model` and render the chip as "free".
 * 4. Options are labelled by display name and charged price, not a bare slug.
 *
 * Item 4 of the PR — cost classification of `openrouter/<a>/<b>` as `Managed`
 * rather than `Byok` — is deliberately NOT here. It is a pure core-side routing
 * decision with no browser-observable surface, and `route_tests.rs` covers it
 * directly.
 *
 * # Environment dependency, stated plainly
 *
 * The catalog comes from the mock backend's `GET /openai/v1/models` route
 * (`scripts/mock-api/routes/llm.mjs`), which serves the curated tier list
 * without `?catalog=openrouter` and the passthrough catalog with it. That
 * two-shape distinction is the feature. Against a real backend with
 * `OPENROUTER_PASSTHROUGH_ENABLED` off the catalog is empty and no select
 * renders — expected behaviour, pinned by its own case below.
