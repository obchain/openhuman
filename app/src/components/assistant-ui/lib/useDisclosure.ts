/**
 * The user's open/closed choice for a disclosure, remembered by a stable key.
 *
 * Tool cards, delegation cards and reasoning blocks live inside assistant-ui's
 * message tree, which unmounts and remounts them more often than it looks: a
 * thread switch, the virtualised history, a message whose parts change shape.
 * With the choice in local `useState` every remount reset it, so a card the
 * user had opened snapped shut under them. Keyed by something that outlives the
 * component (a tool-call id), the choice survives the remount.
 *
 * Only an explicit toggle is stored. Until the user touches a disclosure it
 * follows `defaultOpen`, which callers derive from state that is the same live
 * and on reload, so a streamed turn and the same turn reopened look alike.
 *
 * The store is module-scoped and deliberately not persisted: the choice matters
 * for as long as the card is on screen in this session, not across launches.
 * It is bounded so a long session cannot grow it without limit.
